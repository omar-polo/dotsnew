SQLite has a configuration file that gets executed every time it is
launched.

I like to have a different glyph for the NULL value

	.nullvalue '‚ä•'

and enable the "box" mode

	.mode box

This is pretty new and so it may not work on older version.  It draws an
ASCII box around the result of queries.
